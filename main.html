           While trying to make sense of Gnutella for a hobby of mine, it became increasingly apparent that this is early internet-era stuff.
           Information is scattered across dodgy-looking sites, which more often than not lead to other information no longer available.
           To save you all a trip over to the Internet Archive to scour for everything yourself, I've done the hard work for you.
           This is by no means an exhaustive effort, so by all means, do add documentation through PRs (Pull Requests).

                    A common pitfall in every P2P application is finding an initial accesspoint.
                  Once connected to the network it's quite self regulating but you do need the initial node.  
                  A Gnutella Web Cache (abbreviated as GWebCache) tries to solve this problem.
                  The GWebCache system is as the name implies a register of recent Gnutella Nodes and other web caches.
                  This enables you to find an initial connection by querying one of these caches.

                    I've come across two versions of the specifications for web caches.
                     While most of the web caches I found seem to adhere to the second version, there are still a couple of survivors using the first version.
                     Additionally, I've compiled a list of functioning web caches as of the time of creating this site.
